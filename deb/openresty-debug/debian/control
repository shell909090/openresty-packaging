Description: debug version of OpenResty core server
 This package contains the debug version of the core server for OpenResty.
 Built for development purposes only.
 .
 DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE IN PRODUCTION!
 .
 OpenResty is a full-fledged web platform by integrating the standard Nginx
 core, LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality
 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is
 designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web
 services, and dynamic web gateways.
 .
 By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules (most of which
 are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty effectively
 turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web
 developers can use the Lua programming language to script various existing
 nginx C modules and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance
 web applications that are capable to handle 10K ~ 1000K+ connections in
 a single box.
